        <h2>Tech Career</h2>
        <p>In the beginning I had no idea about coding and after a while of learning I became interested in it as I have always had a interest in IT/computers.
During my bachelor architecture degree I used software to make a plan,design buildings and interior design...
And this is where my interest and skills developed. I would like to develop my skills more in this field as I really do have a passion for IT.
I believe this is the next step I need to pursue my dream career.</p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FySFg78cQI"></iframe>
